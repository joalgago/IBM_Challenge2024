# IBM Quantum Challenge 2024
Personal solutions for IBM Quantum's Challenge 2024. The labs are organized in folders, with the necessary files to run them inside their folders already. The AI transpiler and
Qiskit Serverless notebooks from Lab 3 require a Premium account from IBM Quantum (as of now). All the spaces where the API token from an IBM Quantum account is required for the code
to run were replaced by YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN.
